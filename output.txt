I've added more detailed logging to `src/pages/Attendance.jsx` to help diagnose why the page is crashing after a brief display. The `console.log` statements will show the exact data received from the backend.

Please follow these steps carefully to help me identify the problem:

**Step 1: Ensure your backend server is running and check its console for errors.**

1.  In your terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Run `npm start`.
3.  **Monitor this terminal window for any error messages or unexpected output from the backend.**

**Step 2: Start your frontend development server and monitor its console for errors.**

1.  In *another* terminal, navigate to your project's root directory.
2.  Run `npm run dev`.

**Step 3: Open your browser and navigate to the application, then check the Developer Tools Console.**

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the frontend development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).
2.  **Open the Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I):**
    *   Go to the "Console" tab.
    *   **Crucially, copy and paste *any and all error messages* that appear in the console.** This includes any messages from the `console.log` statements I added, especially "Fetched Members:" and "Fetched Attendance Records:".
    *   Also, check the "Network" tab to see if the API calls to `localhost:3001` are succeeding (200 OK) or failing.

Please provide *all* output from both the backend terminal and the browser's console tab. This detailed information is essential for me to fix the "page shows for a second then it goes white" issue.
